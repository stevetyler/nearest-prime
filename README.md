# Nearest Prime



# Task

Objective: build a small server application that calculates the nearest prime number to a provided number.  For example if I pass '27' to the application it should return '29'.

A few constraints:
It should provide an REST API as its endpoint.
It should be written in typescript and run in node.js
It should use a server framework (restify or express, etc.).   localhost:5000?number=27 { numer: 29 }  
It should have a suitable npm package file and build script.

Credit will be awarded for coding style, structure and test ability.

Please provide your solution either as a zip file, GitHub or bitbucket repository.  This should only take an evening or two.
